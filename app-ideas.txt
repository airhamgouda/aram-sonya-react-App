                    </div>
            


    - Reach:
            Live feed where people can post what dog park they are going to
            Counter for number of the app users at a specific park, for example "Sparkies Dog Park: 12 Puppers here currently!
            Signout of 'park', or create a lifespan timer for user, automatically removing them from count of park after an hour. 
                REACH GOAL: GPS to see what park they are currently at.


    



    Goal: 
        Pull dog parks from a database (for dev, we will use JSON). DONE
        Push them to the DOM as interactable elements.
        Allow user to add park to database.
